**1. What is Power BI?**
Power BI is a business analytics tool by Microsoft that lets you visualize data, share insights, and make data-driven decisions using interactive dashboards and reports.

**2. Main components of Power BI?**

- Power BI Desktop – Create reports
    
- Power BI Service – Share reports online
    
- Power BI Mobile – View on phones/tablets
    
- Power BI Gateway – Refresh data from on-premises
    
- Power BI Report Server – Host reports on-premises
    

**3. Power BI Desktop vs Power BI Service?**  
Desktop is for building reports (offline).  
Service is for publishing, sharing, scheduling, and collaboration (online).

**4. What data sources can Power BI connect to?**  
Excel, SQL Server, SharePoint, Web, APIs, Azure, Oracle, Google Analytics, and many more.

**5. What is DAX?**  
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI to create custom calculations and expressions like measures and calculated columns.

**6. What is the importance of relationships in Power BI?**  
Relationships link tables, allowing you to create visuals using fields from multiple tables, like in a relational database.

**7. Star vs Snowflake schema?**

- Star: Facts connect to dimension tables directly.
    
- Snowflake: Dimension tables are normalized (split into sub-tables).
    

**8. Calculated Column vs Measure?**

- Calculated Column: Row-level, stored in the model.
    
- Measure: Calculated at query time, based on filters.
    

**9. SUM vs SUMX in DAX?**

- SUM: Adds up a column directly.
    
- SUMX: Iterates through rows, applies an expression, and sums the results.
    

**10. What is an inactive relationship?**  
A relationship that is not used by default in visuals. You can activate it using DAX (`USERELATIONSHIP()`)

**11. What is CALCULATE() in DAX?**  
Changes the context in which a calculation is performed. It’s key for complex measures.

**12. How does FILTER() work in DAX?**  
Returns a table that meets a condition. Used to modify context inside `CALCULATE()`.

**13. ALL vs ALLEXCEPT vs ALLSELECTED?**

- ALL: Removes all filters.
    
- ALLEXCEPT: Keeps specified filters.
    
- ALLSELECTED: Keeps filters applied by visuals.
    

**14. EARLIER vs EARLIEST?**  
Used in row context to refer to outer row values in nested calculations.

**15. What is context transition?**  
When row context turns into filter context – happens in measures using `CALCULATE()`.

**16. How to create custom visuals?**

- Use Power BI marketplace.
    
- Or create with TypeScript & D3.js (for advanced).
    

**17. Slicer vs Filter?**

- Slicer: Visual-level, user-interactive.
    
- Filter: Can be applied at visual, page, or report level.
    

**18. What is Drill-through in Power BI?**  
A feature to jump to a detailed report page with filters based on a selected value.

**19. What are Bookmarks used for?**  
Capture report view states – used for storytelling, navigation, and toggling visuals.

**20. How to optimize performance in Power BI?**

- Use Import mode
    
- Reduce columns
    
- Use star schema
    
- Avoid complex measures
    
- Use summary tables
    

**21. What is Power Query?**  
A data connection and transformation tool using the M language for cleaning and shaping data before loading it.

**22. Merge vs Append in Power Query?**

- Merge: Join tables (like SQL JOIN).
    
- Append: Stack tables (like UNION).
    

**23. What is Query Folding?**  
When transformations in Power Query are pushed to the data source, improving performance.

**24. Import vs DirectQuery?**

- Import: Loads data into memory (faster).
    
- DirectQuery: Queries source live (real-time, slower).
    

**25. How to handle nulls in Power Query?**  
Use "Replace Values", "Remove Rows", or custom logic to fill/replace nulls.

**26. What is Row-Level Security (RLS)?**  
A way to restrict data access for users based on roles – implemented via DAX filters.

**27. Dashboard vs Report?**

- Dashboard: Single page, visual summary.
    
- Report: Multi-page, interactive, built in Desktop.
    

**28. How to schedule data refresh?**  
In Power BI Service: Go to Dataset → Settings → Configure refresh schedule.

**29. Can Power BI be embedded in apps?**  
Yes, using Power BI Embedded (Azure service) with REST APIs or iframe.

**30. Power BI Free vs Pro vs Premium?**

- Free: For personal use.
    
- Pro: Share, collaborate, publish.
    
- Premium: Enterprise-level, higher capacity, paginated reports, AI features.
    

**31. How do you implement row-level security (RLS) in Power BI?**  
Go to Modeling → Manage Roles → Create Role, define DAX filters (e.g., `[Region] = "East"`), and publish to Power BI Service to assign users.

**32. What are KPIs in Power BI?**  
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are visual cues that show progress toward a measurable goal – created using indicator, target, and status fields.

**33. Difference between filter context and row context?**

- Filter context: Applied by visuals, slicers, filters.
    
- Row context: Iteration over rows in calculated columns or functions like SUMX.
    

**34. Can we use multiple data sources in a single Power BI report?**  
Yes. Power BI can connect and combine multiple sources (Excel + SQL + Web) using Power Query and relationships.

**35. What is Composite Model in Power BI?**  
A model that combines Import and DirectQuery data sources, offering more flexibility in data modeling.

**36. What is the use of the LOOKUPVALUE function?**  
LOOKUPVALUE retrieves a single value from another table based on a search condition, similar to VLOOKUP in Excel.

**37. What are Quick Measures in Power BI?**  
Pre-built DAX templates for common calculations like YTD, running totals, etc., created using drag-and-drop interface.

**38. How to create a hierarchy in Power BI?**  
Drag and drop related fields (e.g., Year → Month → Day) in the Fields pane to form a drill-down hierarchy.

**39. What is the role of the Power BI Gateway?**  
It bridges cloud-based Power BI Service and on-premises data sources for scheduled refreshes and live connections.

**40. What is incremental refresh in Power BI?**  
Loads only new or updated data instead of full dataset every time. Improves performance for large datasets.

**41. How to handle many-to-many relationships in Power BI?**  
Use a bridge table or composite models, and enable "Both" direction in relationships cautiously.

**42. What are role-playing dimensions?**  
A single dimension (e.g., Date) used in multiple contexts (Order Date, Ship Date) – handled via multiple relationships.

**43. How to create dynamic titles in Power BI visuals?**  
Use a DAX measure like `SelectedValue()` and bind it to the title via "fx" (expression) option in the visual’s format pane.

**44. What are parameters in Power BI?**  
Used in Power Query to define values that can dynamically change (e.g., file paths, filters, limits).

**45. How to troubleshoot a slow Power BI report?**

- Check DAX efficiency
    
- Use fewer visuals
    
- Disable auto-date
    
- Remove unnecessary columns
    
- Enable performance analyzer
    

**46. What are paginated reports in Power BI?**  
Pixel-perfect, printable reports created using Power BI Report Builder, supported only in Premium workspace.

**47. How does drill-down vs drill-through work?**

- Drill-down: Explore hierarchical data in same visual.
    
- Drill-through: Jump to another report page with filters passed.
    

**48. Can you connect Power BI to live web APIs?**  
Yes, using Web connector or Power Query (M language) to call REST APIs and retrieve JSON/XML data.

**49. What are the limitations of DirectQuery mode?**

- Slower performance
    
- Limited DAX functions
    
- 1M row visual limit
    
- No native support for time intelligence
    

**50. How do bookmarks enhance storytelling in Power BI?**  
Bookmarks capture report state (filters, visuals) and allow interactive navigation or guided walkthroughs when combined with buttons.

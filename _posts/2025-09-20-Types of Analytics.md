_Comprehensive Comparison of the 5 Types of Analytics: Tools, Techniques, and Applications_

Modern analytics can be categorized into five primary types, each building upon the previous to create increasingly sophisticated insights. 

**Descriptive analytics** forms the foundation by answering "What happened?"

followed by **Diagnostic analytics** which explores "Why did it happen?"

**Predictive analytics** then forecasts "What will happen?"

**Prescriptive analytics** recommends "What should we do?". 

Finally, **Cognitive analytics** leverages artificial intelligence to process information "How can we think like humans?"

These analytics types don't operate in isolation but rather work together to provide a complete picture of business performance and opportunities. 

Organizations typically begin with descriptive analytics to establish baseline understanding before progressing to more advanced analytical approaches as their data maturity and technical capabilities develop.

## 1. Descriptive Analytics

Descriptive analytics represents the most fundamental and widely adopted form of data analysis, used by over 90% of organizations to summarize historical data and provide insights into past events. 

This analytics type focuses on answering the critical question "What happened?" by examining historical data patterns, trends, and performance metrics.

### Key Techniques

Descriptive analytics employs several core techniques to transform raw data into meaningful information. 

**Data aggregation** consolidates large volumes of information into manageable summaries, while **data visualization** presents complex datasets through charts, graphs, and dashboards that facilitate quick comprehension. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) serve as essential metrics for tracking specific business objectives, and **trend analysis** identifies patterns and changes over time periods.

The process typically involves six critical steps: 
- understanding business requirements
- collecting data from various sources
- cleaning and preparing information
- analyzing data for patterns
- interpreting results within business context
- and presenting findings through comprehensive reports and visuals.

### Business Applications

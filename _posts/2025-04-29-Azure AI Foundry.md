Understanding Azure AI Foundry in detail.

I saw this video on Azure AI Foundry on YouTube by John Savill.

That's really great explanation about Azure AI Foundry's key capabilities. 

This is what I understand about it:

Azure AI Foundry is a unified platform for Data Scientists and AI Engineers to build and deploy AI applications. It is the latest cutting-edge AI tech from Azure.

## Inside Azure AI Foundry

- We have hubs which are basically a way to organize our resources like compute, AI services, endpoints. This is like a master repository for a specific department for example HR, Sales, etc.
- Inside each hub, we have projects. We can have multiple projects in a single hub. These are like grouping of resources. Each project can have resources allocated to it and this project can be used by a particular team for collaboration and creating the AI solution.
- We have model catalog where we can find many generative AI models along with Azure AI traditional models.
- In this model catalog, we can compare multiple models based on many parameters like cost, accuracy, coherence, groundedness etc.
- We also have playground to test our deployed model.
- Fine-tuning option to fine tune a particular model.

I have created a container named "data" here

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notes/blob/image-2.png)

Click on the container and upload anything. I have uploaded an image.

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notes/blob/image-3.png)

Now, if we click on the image, it opens up properties which consists of an URL.

This URL enables to access the image online.

### Change the access level of your blob

Select Change access level.

Set the Anonymous access level to Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only).

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/notes/blob/image-6.png)

Now, you should be able to access the image through URL, initially it was set to private.

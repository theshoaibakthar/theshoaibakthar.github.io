I have been using Power BI in my projects for more than 2 years and the hands-on experience has helped me to understand different scenarios that has come up in the exam.

I believe hands-on experience on Power BI is crucial for the exam because most of the questions are not straight forward and the questions challenge you to think critically for a suitable step to perform in Power BI.

### Microsoft Learn Power BI Course

Microsoft Learn provides well written course on Power BI to prepare for this exam. The interesting part is it also has labs for practice.

This course gives strong foundation to Power BI, and I wish I could have gone through this course while I was starting to learn Power BI.

Check out the course. It is free - [Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/pl-300t00)

Do all the practice labs which are available in each module. It provides good practice and understanding Power BI implementations.

### YouTube

Some YouTube channels to learn Power BI:
- Guy in a Cube

### Docs

## Some tips (which I followed)

First, go through each and every page in Microsoft Learn Power BI course, along with practice labs.

You may not understand some topics, search those topics on YouTube and watch videos related to those topics.

Take practice tests on Microsoft Learn. You can find this on the certification page.

Familiarize yourself with all the question types which may come in the exam.

While attempting the questions during exam, read the question carefully. Some questions can be tricky.

Search for practice questions online, and on YouTube. Cover all questions which you find.

Download Power BI Desktop and practice with sample datasets. Hands on practice is the most important tip. Without this step, it's hard.

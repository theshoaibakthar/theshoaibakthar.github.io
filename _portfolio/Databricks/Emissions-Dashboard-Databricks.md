## Overview

In this project, I built an **interactive United States emissions analysis dashboard** using **Databricks Free Edition**.

The goal was to analyze **real EPA emissions data** and answer practical questions such as:

- Where are emissions geographically concentrated in the U.S.?    
- Which states contribute the most to total emissions?
- How do emissions scale with population at the county level?
- Do highly populated areas necessarily emit more per person?

This project covers the **full analytics lifecycle**:

- Raw data ingestion
- Data cleaning and transformation
- SQL-based analysis
- Dashboard creation and storytelling

## Project Architecture

**Tech Stack**

- Databricks Free Edition    
- Databricks SQL
- Built-in Databricks Dashboards

**Key Skills Demonstrated**

- Working with raw, imperfect data
- SQL aggregations and calculations
- Handling data quality issues (numeric strings, commas)
- Geographic visualization (latitude/longitude)
- Analytical storytelling

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains ~3,000 rows but **many columns**, including:

- Greenhouse Gas emissions (metric tons of CO₂ equivalent)    
- Population
- Latitude & Longitude
- County name
- State name and abbreviation

To keep the project focused, I selected only the fields relevant to **emissions analysis and geography**, rather than attempting to model every variable.

## Step 1: Creating a Databricks Catalog and Table

I started by creating a dedicated catalog to keep the project organized.

```sql
CREATE CATALOG emissions;
```

Inside the `default` schema, I uploaded the raw CSV file and created a table named:

```
emissions.default.emissions_data
```

Databricks automatically inferred column types.  

At this stage, **no transformations were applied** — the table represents **raw source data**, which mirrors real-world analytics workflows.

## Step 2: Understanding the Business Problem

The analysis was framed to build a dashboard that answers:

- Where do emissions occur geographically?    
- Which regions should be prioritized for intervention?
- How do emissions compare relative to population?

This framing guided every query and visualization decision.

## Step 3: Visualizing Emissions by Location (Latitude & Longitude)

The first analysis focused on **geographic distribution**.

```sql
SELECT
	latitude,
	longitude,
	`GHG emissions mtons CO2e`
FROM emissions_data
```

I visualized the raw coordinates using a **point map** in Databricks.

### Insight

- Emissions cluster heavily in the **Mid to Eastern U.S.**    
- The West Coast, despite high population, shows **lower relative emissions**

## Step 4: Calculating Emissions Per Person (County Level)

This step required **data cleaning**, because emissions values were stored as strings with commas.

### Cleaning and Calculation

```sql
SELECT
	county_state_name,
	population,
	TRY_CAST(REPLACE(`GHG emissions mtons CO2e`, ',', '') AS DOUBLE) / NULLIF(CAST(population AS DOUBLE), 0) AS emissions_per_person
FROM emissions_data
ORDER BY emissions_per_person DESC;
```

## Step 5: Scatter Plot — Emissions vs Population

Using the cleaned data, I created a **scatter plot**:

- X-axis: Emissions per person    
- Y-axis: Population
- Tooltip: county_state_name

### Key Findings

- **Highly populated counties** tend to have **lower emissions per person**
- Smaller counties often show **disproportionately high emissions per person**
- Example:
    - Los Angeles County → very high population, low emissions per person
    - Small counties in Nelson / Steele → high emissions per person

## Step 6: Total Emissions by State (Top 10)

Next, I analyzed **which states emit the most overall**.

```sql
SELECT
	state_abbr,
	SUM(TRY_CAST(REPLACE(`GHG emissions mtons CO2e`, ',', '') AS DOUBLE)) AS total_emissions
FROM emissions_data
GROUP BY state_abbr
ORDER BY total_emissions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Step 7: How Much Do the Top 10 States Contribute?

To quantify impact, I calculated what percentage of **total U.S. emissions** comes from the top 10 states.

```sql
WITH top10 AS
(
	SELECT
		state_abbr,
		SUM(TRY_CAST(REPLACE(`GHG emissions mtons CO2e`, ',', '') AS DOUBLE)) AS total_emissions
	FROM emissions_data
	GROUP BY state_abbr
	ORDER BY total_emissions DESC
	LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
	SUM(total_emissions) AS top10_emissions,
	(SUM(total_emissions)/
	(SELECT SUM(TRY_CAST(REPLACE(`GHG emissions mtons CO2e`, ',', '') AS DOUBLE)) FROM emissions_data))*100
AS top10_emissions_percentage
FROM top10;
```

### Result

➡ **The top 10 states account for ~51% of total U.S. emissions**

This single metric adds **strong narrative value** to the dashboard.

## Step 8: Top 10 Emitting Counties

Finally, I identified counties with the **highest absolute emissions**.

```sql
SELECT
	county_state_name,
	population,
	TRY_CAST(REPLACE(`GHG emissions mtons CO2e`, ',', '') AS DOUBLE) AS total_emissions
FROM emissions_data
ORDER BY total_emissions DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Final Dashboard Components

The completed dashboard includes:

1. Emissions map (latitude & longitude)
2. Emissions vs population scatter plot
3. Top 10 emitting states (percentage)
4. Top 10 emitting counties (absolute totals)
5. Supporting annotations and insights

## Key Insights

- Sales Growth: 2021 marked the highest annual sales, with over 60% of revenue coming from the East and West regions. The year 2020 showed a strong 33% YoY sales growth, driven by the consumer segment and consistently strong Q4 performance across all years.

- Revenue Distribution: The top 20% of customers contributed over 49% of total sales, highlighting a Pareto trend and the need for focused customer retention and loyalty strategies.

- Product Returns: Returns were predominantly high in the Office Supplies category and the West region, indicating potential issues with product quality or customer alignment that need to be addressed.
Customer Segmentation: RFM analysis showed that high-value customers, while only 40% of the customer base, accounted for 65% of total revenue—making them a critical segment for targeted marketing and retention efforts.

- New Customer Acquisition (2021): Only 11 new customers were acquired in 2021, contributing $7.36K in sales. This indicates a significant opportunity to improve marketing strategies and attract a broader customer base.
